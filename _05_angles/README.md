## Lesson notes

### 01 - Radians

1. Point out code that uses <code>Math.PI * 2</code> to draw circles on the canvas. Introduce _radians_ as an alternate unit of measuring angles and that <code>Math.PI * 2</code> radians is the equivalent of 360 degrees
2. If students can think geometrically, explain radians as a literal translation of the formula for a circle's circumference, $c=2Ï€r$. Imagine taking a bit of wire exactly the length of a circle's radius, and bending it slightly so it fits anywhere along that circle's circumference. How many of those wires would you need end-to-end to completely surround the circle? You'd need two pi of them (approx. 6.2831853)
3. In <code>lib.js</code>, add these conversion functions:
    ```js
    export function degToRad(d) {
        return d * (Math.PI / 180);
    }

    export function radToDeg(r) {
        return r * (180 / Math.PI);
    }
    ```
    The <code>degToRad</code> function will be used in this project so that there's some experience with it, but point out that we know the radian equivalent of 360 degrees (<code>Math.PI * 2</code>) and writing that out is slightly more efficient than using the conversion function
